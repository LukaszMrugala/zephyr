# Sanitycheck test-cases that are allowed to fail without triggering CI run failure
#   This is a simple bash array which is sourced into the -runner.sh & then used to
#   delete testcases before starting a run
#
SC_ALLOWED_TO_FAIL=(
	"samples/gui/lvgl,sample.gui.lvgl"
)


# Notes:
#
# lvgl - testcases for all platforms are currently disabled, ci limitation
## lvgl tests require external internet connectivity for a git clone operation which is not currently supported across all build agents
